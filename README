telemetrics-client
==================

This package provides the front end component of a complete telemetrics
solution for Linux-based operating systems. Specifically, the front end
component includes:

- telemetrics probes that collect specific types of data from the operating
  system.

- a library, libtelemetry, that telemetrics probes use to create telemetrics
  records and send them to the daemon for further processing.

- a daemon, telemd, that prepares the records to send to a telemetrics server
  (not included in this source tree), or spools the records on disk in case
  it's unable to successfully deliver them.


Build dependencies
==================

- libcheck

- libcurl

- glib

- elfutils, which provides libelf and libdwfl libraries..

- (optional) libsystemd, for syslog-style logging to the systemd journal, and
  socket/path activation of telemd by systemd.
