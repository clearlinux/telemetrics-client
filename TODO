Build
=====
- make sure our AM_CFLAGS do not break older compilers, e.g. compilers
  that do not support -fstack-protector-strong

Probes
======
- add pstore probe (Archana)
- journal probe: detect kernel oopses (Patrick)
- crash probe: add function/register value info to crash payloads (Patrick)
- crash probe: if some symbols are missing from backtraces, attempt the
  debuginfo lookup again after a certain timeout (Patrick)
- crash probe: for non-debug builds, ensure that we are invoked by the kernel,
  and write tests to verify that attempts to run the crash probe for non-debug
  builds fail. (Patrick)

Library
=======
- add API for structured payloads

Other
=====
- set fixed size for system-wide core file ulimit, and afterward notify QA team
  to update the BAT test that checks for the ulimit value.
