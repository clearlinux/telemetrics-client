Indentation
-----------
telemetrics-client uses spaces for indentation (no tabs). To help enforce this
rule, all source files provide modelines; if your editor does not support
modelines, configure your editor accordingly.

Line length
-----------
Wherever possible, try to limit line length to 80 characters.

Coding Style
------------
- Function declarations and invocations should include no space between the
  function name and the open parenthesis:

        spool_max_size_config();

- All other usages of parentheses in code should have one intervening space:

        if (spool_size == -1) {
                ...
        }

- To distinguish function definitions from other top-level constructs, add the
  opening curly bracket on its own line:

        void spool_record(char *headers[], char *body)
        {
                ...
        }

- All other usages of curly brackets in code should include the opening curly
  bracket at the end of the line which opens the block:

        for (i = 0; i < NUM_HEADERS; i++) {
                ...
        }

- if statements should *always* use curly brackets, even when each clause only
  contains a single statement. This is a safeguard to ensure future changes to
  an if statement are not buggy due to forgetting to add the curly brackets
  when needed.

        if (ret == -1) {
                ...
        }

- Comments that span more than one line should use the following style:

        /* This comment
         * spans more
         * than one
         * line.
         */

- For single-line comments, use either of the following forms:

        /* single line comment 1 */

        // single line comment 2

- To make type casts stand out more, include no space between the cast and the
  variable, etc. to cast:

        GString **foo = (GString **)bar;

- Whenever arithmetic operators are used, always include one space before and
  after each operator:

        size = size - offset + 1;

- For pointer variable declarations, pointer dereferences, functions that return
  a pointer, typecasts to a pointer variable, and other related constructs;
  include a single space between the type and '*', and no space between the '*'
  and the following variable, function name, etc. The purpose here is to
  distinguish pointer usage versus arithmetic usage:

        char *payload;
